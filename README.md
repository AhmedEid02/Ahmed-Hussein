## 🌍 About Me
I am an **Agro-Meteorologist and Climate Data Analyst** with an MSc in **Agro-Meteorology and Natural Risk Management** from **Haramaya University, Ethiopia**.  
My work focuses on drought monitoring, satellite-based environmental assessment, and geospatial climate modelling across the **Horn of Africa**.

I integrate **Earth observation, climate datasets, and data science** to turn raw environmental data into **actionable insights**, reproducible workflows, and open-source analytical tools that support resilience planning and climate services.
